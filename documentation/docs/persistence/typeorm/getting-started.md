The `@moogs-nestjs-query/query-typeorm` package provides an implementation of `@moogs-nestjs-query/core` [QueryService](../../concepts/services.md).

This package is built using [typeorm](https://typeorm.io/#/) and [@nestjs/typeorm](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/database#typeorm-integration). If you are unfamiliar with them I suggest you read their documentation first.

## Installation

[Installation Docs](../../introduction/install.md#nestjs-queryquery-typeorm)

## Docs

* [Multiple Databases](./multiple-databases.md) - Docs that layout how to connect to multiple databases and use them with `nestjs-query`
